This is a test project from Sandi Metz' talk, "Get a Whiff of This".

If you want to go through the exercise of refactoring the code please check out the `starting-point` branch.

## Set up

Once the source is downloaded, `cd` into the directory and run `bundle install` (if you don't have bundler, execute `gem install bundler`).

You can run the tests with `rake test`.

This project uses sqlite as a database so you don't have to worry
about installing additional dependencies.
